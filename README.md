# Project-x
Just my dumb stuff
I think I'll try to build a site that checks the status of the largest ISP's in sweden, and creats a dashboard stile site for easy access

# Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package manager)

Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium webdriver-manager
```

For Selenium to work, you also need Google Chrome installed on your system.

If you use a virtual environment, activate it
